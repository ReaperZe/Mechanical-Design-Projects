# Mechanical-Design-Projects
Welcome to my Mechanical Design Portfolio repository. This collection showcases a variety of 3D CAD modeling, part design, assembly design, and engineering drawing projects created using SolidWorks. The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my practical skills in mechanical design, parametric modeling, and product development workflows.

About This Repository

This folder contains multiple mechanical design projects developed for academic work, personal practice, and concept design. Each project reflects attention to design intent, dimensional accuracy, proper constraint usage, and manufacturability considerations. Wherever applicable, projects include part files, assemblies, detailed drawings, and neutral file formats for easy viewing.

Skills Demonstrated

  3D Part Modeling in SolidWorks
  Assembly Design and Mates
  Engineering Drawings with GD&T
  Parametric and Feature-based Design
  Design for Manufacturing considerations
  Exporting models to STEP / STL formats
  Rendering and Visualization
  Folder Contents


Each project folder may include:

  .sldprt – SolidWorks part files
  .sldasm – SolidWorks assembly files
  .slddrw – Technical drawing files
  .STEP / .IGES – Neutral CAD formats
  .STL – 3D printable models
  .png / .jpg – Rendered images
  .mp4 – Model rotation or assembly animations


Purpose

  This repository is intended to serve as a professional portfolio for internships, job applications, and academic evaluation. It allows recruiters and collaborators to explore my design               capabilities and approach to mechanical problem-solving.

Software Used

  SolidWorks (3D CAD Modeling)
  SolidWorks Drawing Environment
  SolidWorks Visualize (Rendering, where applicable)
